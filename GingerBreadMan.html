When she cooked bread in the oven, the gingerbread in the shape of a man jumped out of the tray and ran towards the window. He jumped out of the window and shouted,” I am a gingerbread man, Do not eat me.” Then the lady started chasing him and a bunch of other people also chased him.At the end a fox ate the gingerbread man!</p>
