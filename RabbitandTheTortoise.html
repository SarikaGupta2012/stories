            <p style="font-size:20px;">The tortoise was mocked for being slow-moving, and the hare challenges it to a race. The hare leaves the tortoise behind and being very confident of its triumph, falls asleep midway. Once he wakes up, he finds that his competitor, crawling slowly but steadily, has arrived to the finish line before him.</p>
