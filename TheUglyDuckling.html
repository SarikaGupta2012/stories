            <p style="font-size:20px;">Once upon a time, an ugly, large duckling was hatched into an otherwise little family of perfect ducks. He was so different looking that the mother thought he might even be a turkey. Even though she felt him large and ugly like everyone else did, the mother duck complimented his ability to swim very well.</p>
